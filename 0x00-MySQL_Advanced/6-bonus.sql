-- Write a SQL script that creates a stored procedure AddBonus that adds
-- a new correction for a student.
-- Requirements:
-- Procedure AddBonus is taking 3 inputs (in this order):
-- user_id, a users.id value (you can assume user_id is linked to an existing
-- ....users)
-- project_name, a new or already exists projects - if no projects.name found in
-- the table, you should create it score, the score value for the correction
-- Context: Write code in SQL is a nice level up!
