-- write a SQL script that lists all bands with Glam rock as their main
-- style, ranked by their longevity
-- Requirements:
-- Import this table dump: metal_bands.sql.zip
-- Column names must be: band_name and lifespan (in years until 2022 -
-- please use 2022 instead of YEAR(CURDATE()))
-- You should use attributes formed and split for computing the lifespan
-- Your script can be executed on any database

SELECT 
    band_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN split IS NULL THEN 2022 - formed
        ELSE split - formed
    END AS lifespan
FROM 
    metal_bands
WHERE 
    style LIKE '%Glam rock%'
ORDER BY 
    lifespan DESC;
